styleSRC
========

I like the idea of [style tiles](http://styletil.es/), but as an early deliverable for a __website__, I'm not sold on the end-product. To hand over a file - usually a JPG or a PDF - for a website just seems weird to me.

So I've created this thing, __[styleSRC](http://thecodezombie.co.uk/styleSRC/)__

It acts much like a style tile, but it's all web-based; hex-refs, browser-rendered fonts and all that jazz. To me, it's a nicer deliverable that more accurately represents your end-product.

_styleSRC_ isn't meant to be the beginnings of a styleguide, it isn't set in stone, it's simply the beginnings of a project once you've come to some *early* design decisions. Just grab a copy of _styleSRC_ and bash in what you've come up with, then stick it online somewhere. It takes literally 5-10 minutes and looks so much better.

If there's some feedback from the client and you need to do some changes, do them in code and quickly push them back up to your online _styleSRC_. No passing around ridiculously named versions between people.

Also, I've made it responsive; the hope being that when you fire your link over in an e-mail, anyone can see it on whatever device they're using.

_styleSRC_ is in its really early stages, so please don't rip it to shreds...it's my *first* GitHub repo.  
If you've got a suggestion for a feature or can think of ways to improve it then fork it or send me a tweet at [@thecodezombie](https://twitter.com/thecodezombie)

### Documentation ###

I've tried to make this as straight-forward as possible. The `index.html` file has the majority of what you need to edit. Search `!!` and you'll jump through the stages you need to change. _styleSRC_ uses Sass...because I want to.

### Features ###

So far, there's just 'Logo', 'Colour Palette' and 'Typography', but I've got ideas for more:

#### Upcoming Ideas ####
- __Logo treatment:__ What the logo will look like on a light or dark background, or overlaid on a photorgraph.
- __Icons:__ Grab the icon-font, and drop in the relevent classes. Automatically styles into an example list.
- __Example copy:__ Examples of your font in the usual dummy text (e.g. _Lorem Ipsum_ and _The quick brown fox_)
- __Photography / Illustrations:__ Examples that you think would be suitable for the website.
- __Social names:__ For when your project is brand new and you want to clearly propose the Facebook page or Twitter handle
